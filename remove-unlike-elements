an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

*Use the arguments object for this algorithm



// `...args` spread operator to represent an array for the provided destroyer args

function destroyer(arr, ...args) {
 return arr.filter(i => !args.includes(i))
}


destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3);
