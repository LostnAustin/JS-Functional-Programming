Return a new array containing only the positive integers.


//ES6 notation
// set a variable num to check that it is greater than 0
// the number must be positive integer if its remainder is 0, after dividing against itself (with a forced parseInt() check function)



const squareList = arr => {
    return arr
          .filter(num => num > 0 && num % parseInt(num) === 0)
          .map(num => (num ** 2));

};

const squaredIntegers = squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);
