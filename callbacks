Functional Programming involves simple isolated functions, w/o any side effects outside the function scope.

Callbacks: functions passed into another function to deide the invoking of that function. Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed /returned from another function are called `first class functions`. All functions are first class in JS. The function passed / returned from  a function is referred to as a LAMBDA




// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};
