Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.



function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
//merge arrays to make easier to work with

const newArr = arr1.concat(arr2)
                   .filter(i => !arr1.includes(i) || !arr2.includes(i));         //make sure `i` is NOT included in each arr, return solo values to newArr
  
  return newArr;
}

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
